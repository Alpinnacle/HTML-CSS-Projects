		Out of the night that covers me,<br>
		Black as the pit from pole to pole,<br>
		I thank whatever gods may be<br>
		For my unconquerable soul.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		In the fell clutch of circumstance<br>
		I have not winced nor cried aloud.<br>
		Under the bludgeonings of chance<br>
		My head is bloody, but unbowed.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Beyond this place of wrath and tears<br>
		Looms but the Horror of the shade,<br>
		And yet the menace of the years<br>
		Finds and shall find me unafraid.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		It matters not how strait the gate,<br>
		How charged with punishments the scroll,<br>
		I am the master of my fate,<br>
		I am the captain of my soul.<br>
